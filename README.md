## QR Code Generator Script
---

This script is designed to create a QR code image from a provided link.

### Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python**: The script is written in Python. You can download and install Python from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/).
- **pip**: Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage Python packages. It usually comes installed with Python. If not, you can install it separately by following [pip's installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
- **Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**: Although not mandatory, it's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. This ensures that your project's dependencies are separate from other projects, preventing potential conflicts.

### Setting Up

Follow these steps to set up and run the script:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

    If you choose to use a virtual environment, navigate to the directory where you want to set up your project using your terminal or command prompt. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    virtualenv <your_environment_name>
    ```

    Replace `<your_environment_name>` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

2. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**

    Clone the GitHub repository containing the QR code generator script to the directory where you've set up your project.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory using your terminal or command prompt. Then, install all the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This command will ensure that all the necessary libraries and packages are installed within your virtual environment (if you're using one).

4. **Replace Code and Run:**

    Now, you're ready to generate QR codes. Replace the placeholder code in the script with your desired link and file name. Once you've made the necessary changes, run the script within your virtual environment. The QR code image corresponding to your link will be generated.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your script. Once executed, the script will prompt you to enter the link for which you want to generate the QR code and the desired file name for the generated QR code image.
